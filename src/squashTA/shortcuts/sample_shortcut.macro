    =>

// will load the xml file '{file_name}' and convert it to a dbunit dataset, that will be registered under the name '{converted_name}'
// note that the name '__{%%rand1}.xml' and the likes are just a trick for name generation, just to make sure
// that it won't collide with another name in the same test. Read the documentation for details about shortcuts.

LOAD {file_name} as __{%%r1}.file
CONVERT __{%%r1}.file TO xml(structured) AS __{%%x1}.xml
CONVERT __{%%x1}.xml TO dataset.dbunit(dataset) AS {converted_name}
